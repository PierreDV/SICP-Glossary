# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs Glossary

- Abstraction
  - Definitions that associate names with values are an example of abstraction.
- Applicative-order evaluation
  - a family of evaluation orders in which a function's arguments are
    evaluated completelt before the function is applied
- Argument - the acutal input expression passed to a function or procedure.
- Case analysis - an assessement of scenarios that an algorithm will encounter.
- Clauses - a logical rule in a logic program
- Combination
- Compound data - a data type made up of more than one component.
- Compound expression
- Compound procedure
- Computation
  - any type of arithmetic or non-arithmetis calculation that is well-defined.
- Computational object - Anything that can be the value of a variable.
- Conditional
  - a programming language construct that performs different computations or
    actions or return different values depending on the value of a predicate.
- Consequent expression
- Data - stuff that we want to manipulate.
- Definitions
- Environment - memory that keeps track of name-object pairs.
- Evaluation rule
- Expression
- Formal parameter
- Global Environment
- Interpreter
- Machine instructions
- Memory
- Mutable data
- Nesting
- Node - a basic unit of a data structure.
- Normal-order evaluation
- Numeral
- Operands
- Operator
- Predicate
  - a procedure that returns, or expression whose value is interpreted as,
    either true or false.
- Prefix notation
  - the convention of placing the operator to the left of the operands.
- Pretty-printing
- Primitive data
  - a string, number or boolean would be an example of primitive data.
- Primitive procedure
  - arithmetic operations such as "+" and "-" are examples of primitive
    procedures.
- Process
- Procedure - descriptions of the rules for manipulating data.
- Procedure application
- Procedure definition
- Procedural
- Program execution
- Read-eval-print-loop
- Recursion
- Special forms
- Stream proccessing
- Subexpression
- Substitution model
- Syntax
- Syntactic sugar
- Symbol
- Terminal node - a node with no branches stemming from it.
- Tree accumulation
- Value
- Variable
